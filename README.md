 Predicting Customer Churn in Credit Card Services Using Orange
This repository contains the workflow and documentation for predicting customer churn in the credit card services industry using the Orange data mining tool.

Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is essential for businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement effective retention strategies. This project focuses on building predictive models using machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict churn outcomes.

Workflow Overview
ðŸ”„ Key Steps in the Process:
Data Exploration:

Visualized and explored customer data to understand trends and patterns.
Data Cleaning:

Processed and converted numerical and categorical data for machine learning.
Merged and split datasets into training and testing data (80/20 split).
Machine Learning Models:

Applied multiple algorithms, including:
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Evaluated and compared their performance to determine the most effective model.
Evaluation:

Metrics Used: Accuracy, precision, and recall.
[Add results here, e.g., "Logistic Regression achieved the best results with 85% accuracy."]
Tools Used
Orange: A powerful open-source data mining and visualization tool.
